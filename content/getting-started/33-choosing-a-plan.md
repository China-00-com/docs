You can view the different plan price points by clicking the 'GB size' dropdown menu:

![../src/img/getting-started/plans.png](../src/img/getting-started/plans.png)

Barricade is a 'pay for what you use' service - you pay in terms of your GB usage (bandwidth).

Whatever you select here will still be **free to use for your trial period** - and you can always adjust the plan if you need more or less data over time.
