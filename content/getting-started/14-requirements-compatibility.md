### Windows Support

We currently don't support Windows servers, but it's on our product roadmap. If you'd like to be added to our early access list for Windows, [let us know](https://barricade.io/about#contact-info) and we'll keep you informed.  

### Running the Agent on Docker

We are currently testing a new version of our agent that runs natively on Docker.

We'll be shipping Docker support in early 2016 - [get in touch](https://barricade.io/about#contact-info) if you'd like to get early access!
