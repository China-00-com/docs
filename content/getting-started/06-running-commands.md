You'll need to connect to your server via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) to run the commands - how you go about doing this depends on the type of server you're using (AWS, DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, etc).

If you're unsure about this, see [LINK NEEDED] _'[How Do I Run the Install Command]_' or check your cloud provider's documentation.
