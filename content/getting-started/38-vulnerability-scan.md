Once the Agent is installed, a short video will appear in your dashboard while Barricade connects to your server and analyzes it for the first time.

After the video, you will see the results of an initial vulnerability scan - a quick check over the OS and packages installed on your server.

If you're running any out-of-date software packages, the scan will let you know - highlighting things that are in need of updating or patching. Any vulnerabilities will be saved as Cases to your dashboard, so you can review them (and follow their recommendations) at a later stage.

The Case page will provide details on the vulnerabilities, and give recommendations.
