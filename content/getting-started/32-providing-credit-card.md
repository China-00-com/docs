We require a credit card to verify all signups - but don't worry - we won't charge you anything to your card. With Barricade, **you only pay for what you use**; and nothing is charged while you're on the free trial plan.

We'll notify you every step of the way about your trial and your usage, so there are no hidden charges and you can cancel your account at any time without headaches.

See [our pricing page](https://barricade.io/pricing/) for more information. If you have any questions about the trial signup or our pricing plans, [let us know](https://barricade.io/about/#contact-info).
