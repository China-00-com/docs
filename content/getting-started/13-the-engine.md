Our platform engine makes decisions in real-time. Data is received from the agent and processed through statistical (machine learning) models to make decisions. When an attack is detected, the engine triggers an alert and we notify you immediately through our app and integration channels.

As new data comes in, the engine learns about different types of behaviors for your infrastructure and what seems to be normal behavior based on the services running.

The Engine is designed toÂ distil complex machine learning concepts such as artificial neural networks, anomaly detection, and ensemble learning into consumable and actionable information.

For details on the various behaviors & attacks that Barricade detects - [see the Security Guide](../security-guide).
