You'll find the installation command in the top panel of the Barricade app - click the New Agent button to reveal the install code, which you will need to **copy**, then **paste and run** on your server.

## What is Installed?

The install command sets up a Barricade Agent on your server - a simple, lightweight package that is used to monitor activity on your server. See [What is an Agent?](#overview) for more details.

> We will be open sourcing the Agent code on our [Github](https://github.com/barricadeio/) page in the coming weeks.
