To get up and running with Barricade, go to [app.barricade.io](https://app.barricade.io/). First-time visitors will see this screen with account creation instructions:

![../src/img/getting-started/onboard-1.gif](../src/img/getting-started/onboard-1.gif)

If you've previously created an account, you can login by clicking _'[Already Signed Up](https://app.barricade.io/login)'_. To create a new account, you'll be asked for:

* an email address
* a password _(make it a [good one](https://xkcd.com/936/)!)_
* a credit card
