For more details on the Agent and how it works, see the [Agent Overview](#overview).

**The Agent is not detected.**  
If you're experiencing problems during Agent installation, check that your server is compatible - [server OS requirements](#os-requirements-compatibility).

If your server is compatible, try [re-registering the agent](https://docs.barricade.io/using-barricade/#re-register-agent) or [contact us](https://barricade.io/about#contact-info) for help.

**I'm not sure how to run the command on a server.**  
You'll need to connect to the server via SSH to run the command - see [our guide](#running-commands) here.
