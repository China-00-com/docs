Once you sign up on [app.barricade.io](https://app.barricade.io/), you'll automatically start a free trial - giving you the full Barricade experience without having to pay anything!

The length of your trial is based on data, rather than time (as is our full [pricing](https://barricade.io/pricing/)) - every server is different. We will monitor the network traffic in and out of your server until the **1GB limit** is reached. The busier your server, the more data we collect and analyze for issues.

Once your trial data is used up, your trial is finished and you will be notified by email with next steps. 

The trial should give you an idea of how much data your servers send and receive over time, helping you determine which [price plan](https://barricade.io/pricing/) would best suits your needs. [Get in touch](https://barricade.io/about/#contact-info) if you have any questions or have special requirements - we're happy to arrange custom plans to fit your organization.
