"The reason we decided to invest in Microsoft Azure’s platform is simply because of the amount of work they’ve put into the security of their platform over the past few years, and the last few months. In December 2015, the Azure team released the Azure Security Center which is an amazing step towards a stronger and more responsible security stance. Whilst Microsoft might not have been synonymous with responsible security practices in the past the Microsoft Azure team has been working hard to turn this image around. So far, they’ve been doing great work."
