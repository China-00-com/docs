Weâ€™ve released a new update to monitoring Agents - adding more support for Ubuntu systems and continuing to improve the performance of Agents.

To apply these changes, you'll need to manually [Update Your Agents](../../using-barricade/#updating-agents).

Details:

- Clearer feedback and error messaging during installation
- Adds support for the latest versions of Ubuntu (15.04, 15.10)
- Optimized performance for higher bandwidth servers
