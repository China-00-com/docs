We've shipped some changes in response to customer requests, to improve the organization of Cases in the app.

Now similar, repetitive cases will be combined into **groups** so they can be viewed, assessed and resolved in batches, to reduce the amount of noise (and clicks) a user is presented with as new cases are detected.

These changes have been rolled out on [app.barricade.io - login](https://app.barricade.io/login) to see them in action!
