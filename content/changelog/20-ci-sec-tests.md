We've added a new feature that lets you log automated C.I. security tests inside the Barricade app interface.

We're big believers in [Continuous Integration](https://blog.barricade.io/continuous-security/) - this change lets you logÂ details from penetration tests (through a special Barricade webhook url) that you run alongside other test suites that you run as part of your development cycle.
