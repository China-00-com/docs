We've shipped a big update to our detection engine, to improve the criteria for detecting events, attacks and incidents. This will ensure greater coverage for systems being monitored by Barricade.

These changes will result in improved behavior of our detection engine:

*   adds new, wider and smarter criteria for detection
*   improved detection of SSH login attacks
*   better classify different types of web app attack
*   reduces false positives

_These changes are now live in our central engine - **no action is required on your part.**_
