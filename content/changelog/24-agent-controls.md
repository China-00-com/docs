We've updated the Agents page in our app, adding simple one-click  controls to our interface, which make it easier to manage your Agents:

### Pausing, Restarting & Retiring Agents

Until now, Agents were controlled by running stop and start commands directly on your server (via SSH) - now a one-click button let's you manage Agents with ease.

Older Agent versions will need to be [updated](../../using-barricade/#updating-agents) to the latest version in order to use this feature. See [here for further documentation](../../using-barricade/#stopping-and-removing-agents) on pausing and removing agents
