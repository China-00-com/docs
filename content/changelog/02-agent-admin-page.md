We've added a new admin section to the Barricade app: [app.barricade.io/agents](https://app.barricade.io/agents)

This section allows you to see what Agents are running, how busy they are and how to control them (stop, start, etc).

### Agent Controls

You can stop and start the agent by running commands on your server - this new Agent section provides instructions on how to do this - see our [Agent documentation](LINK NEEDED) for more details.

```
service barricade start  
service barricade stop  
service barricade status  
```
