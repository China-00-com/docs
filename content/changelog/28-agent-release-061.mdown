Weâ€™ve shipped an update to our monitoring Agent, to improve performance and minimise the amount of server resources used by the Agent.

To apply these changes, [update your Agents now](https://docs.barricade.io/using-barricade/#updating-agents).

## Improvements:

- Optimized performance for higher bandwidth servers
- Pool connections to Barricade's streaming API
- More informative debug logs, including file and line number
- Experimental support for Docker containers
- Reduced default flush_frequency from 0.1s to 0.5s for better performance.
- Add warnings for when libpcap is dropping packets
- (bugfix) registration no longer fails when machine hostname unavailable
- (bugfix) cache now enforces owner only r/w permissions
- (bugfix) cache now purged regularly even when no connection
  can be established to Barricade (prevents disk space being exhausted)
