If you're looking to stop using Barricade entirely, you can [close your account through this page](https://app.barricade.io/dashboard/settings/team/close). Only admin users can close an account, for security reasons.

We're sorry to see you go - if there's any feedback you'd like to leave for us, please do [submit a comment](https://barricade.io/about#contact-info).
