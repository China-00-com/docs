Barricade helps protect your data by checking for signs of sensitive information. If credit card info or content of a sensitive nature is found to be publicly visible; you will be alerted immediately.

## Causes

It's important to keep sensitive information safe online - in the wrong hands, credit card and identifying information can be used to commit fraud and identity theft. 

Barricade will help you identify any such exposed information on your systems - if someone posts credit card details to a public-facing part of your website or application, you will be alerted in real time.
